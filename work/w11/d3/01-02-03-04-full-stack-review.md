## Full Stack Review 

As a class let's build a simple CRUD (really just C & R) application using React.

[This](https://wn72njl09l.codesandbox.io/) is a clickable prototype of this application. 

## Brief Description 

This application has a single resource: beans. We should be able to create and view all beans. We should also be able to see details about a single bean.

## What is Full Stack 

This application is "full-stack". To build it we will use the following technologies: 

* MongoDB/Mongoose 
* Node/Express 
* React
